Libraries
The Anaconda distribution system comes with many libraries already pre-installed. However, because I will be doing analysis of linguistic patterns, I will be using other libraries that are not included in the Anaconda distribution system. Thus, these libraries need to be installed individually.
Here’s a list of all the libraries that will be used in the program and how to install them. Note that many libraries come already pre-installed with Anaconda.
